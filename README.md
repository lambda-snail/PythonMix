# PythonMix

A hodge podge of various Python things. Currently only two projects in this folder, but more will surely be added in the future.

# Content Guide

## WinPyTest
Contains two projects that were created when I explored the WinPy package. One project is an implementation of the famous snake game that uses Excel as a GUI. The other project similarly abuses Excel to render jpeg images. (Warning, can be really slow!)
